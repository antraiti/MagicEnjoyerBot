# Magic Enjoyer Bot
A discord bot under creation for use in the DMN Magic Discord.

#Recent Update
Added tournament commands and controller. Connects to challonge API. Currently only creates Shipley Draft tournaments which are a 3 round swiss with tie breakers determined by 4 different layers. PLayers are inputed with an experience value which is used for the 4th tie breaker layer. Then a double elim is created based on the seeding.
